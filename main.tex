\section{Abstract}

Software merging is a necessity for large-scale software development
and while there are many code version systems to help with this, many
of them don't take the structure of the code into account. We propose
to develop a merge tool that will utilise the PDStore%
\footnote{PDStore is a Triplestore database developed at the University of Auckland%
} database to maintain and analyse the structure of the data.

The aim of the tool is to utilise information related to the structure
of a file stored in PDStore and highlight the conflicts that arise
in merging. The proposal highlights the requirements, milestones and
possible evaluation methods for the research project.


\section{Motivation}

%Today's code version systems are based on textual comparisons. Being
%textual based means that they do not understand the structure of the
%code, and as a result the tools are unable to fully assist the developer
%with code merging. This gave a reason to utilise the extra information
%that can aid in the merging.


Developing a merge tool that maintains information in a structured
form, gives scope to improve the way that conflicts and changes are
showed. This motivated us to explore the effectiveness and usability
of such merge tools and how they compare to existing merge tools.


\section{Related Work}

\cite{SemanticDiff} describes a tool called “Semantic diff” and techniques
used in that tool to show the effect of modifications. The tool aims
at providing the user with a summarised report of semantic changes
between two versions of a procedure, and focuses on minimising any
spurious differences such as, renaming local variables. While the
tool provides knowledge of variable dependences within a procedure,
it is not very helpful when considering an entire program because
the tool does not maintain any relationship between method invocation
and method definition.

In \cite{XMLMerge} a technique for performing a 3 way structured
XML merge is described. The technique involves defining merge rules
derived from common use cases of XML editing. While there are similar
problems, a few differences exist. By the nature of XML, the local
structure is important. The rules made in \cite{XMLMerge} 
become invalid for flexible structured data such as code.
We will utilise PDStore and abstract the tool in such a way that it can be used to 
assist in merging a variety of structured documents.

The system described in \cite{finegraned} utilises fine-grained revision control functionality to keep track of program modifications and support merging.  The merge tool of this system defines rules, using the user’s past revisions to suggest a merged result to the user and also allows the user to make changes to the temporary result. While the tool automatically generates a merged result, the basis of these rules are related to user configuration rather than the merge tool defining the rules.

\cite{mergegraph} describes the problems associated with common textual
based merging. It proposes a solution that can be applied to software
artefacts of different types. The solution involves representing information
with extra information such as namespaces appended with UIDs. Once
the data is represented in this special structure, the job of analysing
two structures should be made easier.


\section{Requirements}

A successful execution of the research endeavour should meet the following
requirements: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visually show the changes between two transactions with the use of
tree views.
\item Allow the user to specify what should exist in the new state after
merge. Merge in this case is combining two states of a store to produce
a third state. 
\item Offers the ability to perfrom a three way merge.
\item Integrate into PDStore application.
\item Evaluate the usability of the tool comparing with existing merge tools. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design and Implementation}

The underlying technology used in the proposed method involves using
PDStore to be able to form a structured view of the code. The merging
logic will be written in Scala, while the GUI will be designed in
Swing.

Figure 1 is an example that illustrates a possible GUI for three way
merge involving PD Tree Views. The title string belonging to the LOTR
book in the My book library database has differing values in each
of the three existing versions(Base, Version A and Version B). We
hope to colour code information such as modified items and or items
in conflict to help better inform the user of the types of changes.
The user can select items from different versions to be included in
the merged representation by clicking on the checkbox beside the items.

\section{Evaluation}

This evaluation will consist of an usability testing and comparative
analysis with existing merge tools.

As part of the usability testing, paper prototypes will be used to
evaluate the feasibility of the design of the User Interface of our
tool. This study will reveal both fundamental and minor flaws in the
UI that would need to be fixed before the final milestone. Specific
scenarios will be constructed outlining various use cases that will
then be run through by the participants on multiple different UI designs.
The participants will be asked to think out loud, so that their thought
process can be observed and evaluated. Feedback will then be collected
from the participants at the end through the use of a questionnaire
which will then be used to measure the usefulness of each design.

Any identified flaws will then be corrected and the test will then
be undertaken again so as to verify that the flaws are indeed fixed.

The comparative analysis will consist of test cases outlining major
scenarios will be laid out at the start of the project and will later
be run against existing merge tools and our developed merge tool.
The outcome of these test scenarios will help determine the effectiveness
of the tools under different scenarios


\section{Project Plan}

Listed below are the three milestones for this project %\newline adding a new line puts too much space over here

\begin{description}
\item [{Milestone One:}] Successfully identify the type of simple structural
changes


This involves defining rules and defining a notion of “sameness” for
two code artefacts. The PDStore database will be used to compare the
two different versions of the code. Completion criteria involves being
able to generate output that clearly identify the changes. \\
 \textbf{Due Date:} 15th April 2014

\item [{Milestone Two:}] Perform merging of simple structural changes


After being able to identify the changes, we need to define appropriate
rules for merging. To complete the milestone, the merger will be required
to successfully merge files for a few defined scenarios. \\
 \textbf{Due Date:} 30th April 2014

\item [{Milestone Three:}] Integrate the added functionality to existing
PDStore based versioning tool~


Integrating the added functionality will allow us to conduct our evaluation
on users. This will be key in determining the usefulness and effectiveness
of the changes.\\
 \textbf{Due Date:} 12th May 2014
